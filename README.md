This repository is part of the our proposed "Non-Lossy Ground Truth Comparison via Convolutional Auto-Encoders for Rethinking Image Inpainting via a Mutual Encoder-Decoder with Feature Equalizations" as part of the reproducibility project for the Deep Learning course CS4240 at the TU Delft.

## MEDFE CAE

The implementation of our proposed model is a combination of the original MEDFE repository https://github.com/KumapowerLIU/Rethinking-Inpainting-MEDFE and the CycleGAN-and-pix2pix repository https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix of which we just only used the global set-up for the convolutional auto-encoder. Our combined repository with some modifications such as loading the encoder into MEDFE as well as changed ground truth calculations can be found in this repository. For a discussion and motivation together with results and their evaluation of our proposed model, we would like to refer you to our paper here [TODO link].
